               This plugin is still under active development.

         It probably won't eat your data, but don't hate me if it does.

Threesome is a Vim plugin for resolving conflicts during three-way merges.
It's designed to be used as a merge tool for version control systems like

==============================================================================
1. Version Control Integration                                  *ThreesomeVCS*

Threesome is meant to be called by your version control system when it needs
you to resolve merge conflicts.  You will need to configure your VCS to do
this before you can use Threesome.

*Note: If you'd like to use a Vim GUI instead of console vim, replace
       "vim" in the following commands with your choice of "mvim" or "gvim".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 Mercurial                                                *ThreesomeVCS_hg*

Add the following lines to "~/.hgrc": >

    [merge-tools]
    threesome.executable = vim
    threesome.args = -f $base $local $other $output -c 'ThreesomeInit'
    threesome.premerge = keep
    threesome.priority = 1

Mercurial will now open Vim with Threesome whenever a file has merge conflicts
which need to be resolved.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2 Git                                                     *ThreesomeVCS_git*

Add the following lines to "~/.gitconfig": >

    [merge]
    tool = threesome

    [mergetool "threesome"]
    cmd = "vim -f $BASE $LOCAL $REMOTE $MERGED -c 'ThreesomeInit'"
    trustExitCode = true

If a "git merge" or "git pull" fails with merge conflicts you can now run
"git mergetool".  Git will loop over all the files with conflicts and allow
you to resolve them with Vim and Threesome.

==============================================================================
2. Basic Usage                                                *ThreesomeUsage*

Threesome takes a lot of inspiration for its user interface from Adobe
Lightroom, a photo editing program.

When resolving merge conflicts your goal is:

  - Examine the three files describing the changes being merged.
  - Combine these changes into a fourth file (the "result").
  - Save the result to disk.
  - Exit Vim with a non-error status code to tell the VCS the merge succeeded.

Threesome has several "modes" to help you work with the various files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Files                                               *ThreesomeUsage_files*

When resolving a merge there are four files you will work with:

Original                                       *ThreesomeUsage_files_original*
    The original file, as it appears in the parent revision of the two
    revisions being merged.

One                                                 *ThreesomeUsage_files_one*
    The file as it appears in the first revision being merged.

    This is usually the "current" revision, or the one you are at when you
    run "hg merge REV").

Two                                                 *ThreesomeUsage_files_two*
    The file as it appears in the second revision being merged.

    This is usually the "target" revision, or the one you specify in the
    "hg merge REV" command).

Result                                           *ThreesomeUsage_files_result*
    The result of merging the two revisions of the file.

    This is the file that your version control system expects to contain the
    final result once you're done.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 Modes                                               *ThreesomeUsage_modes*

Threesome has four "modes" or "views" for working with the files.

Grid                                               *ThreesomeUsage_modes_grid*
    Shows all four files at once to give you an overview of the merge.

    See |ThreesomeModes-grid| for more information.

Loupe                                             *ThreesomeUsage_modes_loupe*
    Shows a single file at a time for close examination of a single file.

    See |ThreesomeModes-loupe| for more information.

Compare                                         *ThreesomeUsage_modes_compare*
    Shows two files at a time for examining the movement of changes between
    pairs of files.

    See |ThreesomeModes-compare| for more information.

Path                                               *ThreesomeUsage_modes_path*
    Shows three files at a time:

      - The original
      - Either one or two
      - The result

    Used for examining how a change moves through one "path" or "branch"
    of the merge.

    See |ThreesomeModes-path| for more information.

3. Key Bindings                                                *ThreesomeKeys*

Threesome makes use of <localleader> for all of its key bindings to avoid
clashing with global mappings. If you've never used <localleader> now
would be a good time to read the |maplocalleader| documentation and
configure a key for it.

All keybindings are used across (almost) all modes.

The behavior of some of them changes depending on the current mode, but the
effects should be fairly intuitive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Mode Selection Keys                                   *ThreesomeKeys_mode*

<localleader>g                                       *Grid*

                        Switch to compare view.

<localleader>p                                       *Path*
                        Switch to path view.

                        Cycle through various diff combinations.

<localleader>D                                    *DiffOff*
                        Turn off all diffs.

<localleader>N                                   *Previous*
                        Move to the previous unresolved conflict.

<localleader>q                                       *Quit*
                        Save the result file and exit Vim.

                        Indicates to the VCS that the merge was
                        successful and it should use the current
                        contents of the result file as the result.

<localleader>CC                                    *Cancel*
                        Exits Vim with an error code (like |:cquit|).
                        Indicates to the VCS that the merge was
                        NOT successful.

10. Credits                                                 *ThreesomeCredits*

Threesome was originally written by Steve Losh after he got fed up with the
lack of a powerful, intuitive, beautiful three-way merge program on OS X.

A lot of the inspiration for the layout of the code came from vim-orgmode.

The UI is a combination of ideas from Conflict2Diff.vim, Fugitive.vim, and
Adobe Lightroom.
