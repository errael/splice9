        What are they?

=== Do the other premerge options work? keep-merge3, keep-mergediff

=== If vim version or python problem,
    execute (or option) :cq when popup dismissed

=== boolsetting bug, see comment with defaults in splice.vim



? disable mappings by default
    NO. Doesn't make sense to have an option to disable mappings.
    Espcially considering typically only runs from SCM.

? can vim script be written compatibly, some kind of vim9ifavailable setting

? python interface to vim is nice, magic variables/lists/arrays of vim objects.
  Is there something like this in vim?

Logging
    vim function Log(string)

    " splice_log_file defaults to $HOME/SPLICE_LOG
    let g:splice_log_file = $HOME .. '/play/SPLICE_LOG'
    " splice_log_enabled defaults to false
    let g:splice_log_enable = v:true

KeyBinding
    Stay compatible with v1.1.0, circa 2012. DirDiff latest is like this.
    NOTE: the Splice bindings are only done after SpliceInit is invoked
          so if Splice is only used from SCM, these bindings should
          not interfere with other plugins. In particular, some of these
          bindings overwrite DirDiff bindings.

    Highest priority are per command mappings
        g:splice_bind_<command> = '<mapping>'
        where <command> ::= Grid | Loupe | ...
    For example
        g:splice_bind_Grid = '-g'  " this is the current default
        g:splice_bind_Grid = '<M-g>'  " use the meta key

    There is a flag to control whether or not to setup mappings for the
    Splice commands.
        g:splice_bind_enable
    This flag Defaults to 1 for compatibility. But it is recommended to
    explicitly set this if you want mappings. The default may change in
    the future to avoid changing user mappings by default.

    Per command mappings take precedence. Any commands not mapped with
    "g:splice_bind_*" will get the default mapping. If a command mapping
    is an empty string, '', or set to 'None', it will not be mapped.

    Copy/paste to assist setup; these are the defaults (<prefix> == '-')
        g:splice_bind_Grid             = '-g'
        g:splice_bind_Loupe            = '-l'
