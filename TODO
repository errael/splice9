TODO:   option to disable mouse/rollover

TODO:   If not vim9script, map SpliceInit (or whatever) to no vim9 message.
        Or, make message clear that the plugin should be removed?

TODO:   remove startup column bounce workaround

TODO:   Implement log category filtering on the vim side

TODO:   Get rid of prop_delete since all lines in HUD are deleted.

TODO:   Settings for highlight.
 
TODO:   ActivateGrid/DeactivateGrid probably should be incorporated into
        mode.vim, not keys, since it also affects which keys do what...

TODO:   Shortcut as button with list and popup when hover?
        More state info: Diff on/off; scrollbind on/off (use '*' like mode)
        Which commands valid: grey out , don't higlight rollover
        Show diff #0-n
        Make DiffOff a toggle. Can toggle, keep diff#.

        Grid class has 4 "key_use_*" methods; show which does what when.

        UseHunk is a special case. There are three vals.
            Show either 'u1 & u2', or 'u'.
            Some dependency on focused window?
        Which file can be selected: orig, one, two, res
            May, or may not, depend on focused window.
            In some cases, rather than loading that file into window,
            it switches to the window named.

TODO:   Higlight interactions with vim's diff mode.
        Query vim to find out buffer-line/window-line correspondence
        for conflict display across all windows. Other uses?

TODO:   Use construct like: buffers.result.winnr (NOTE: the -1)
        Make winnr a property rather than method?

TODO:   Add help tag 'Splice' *before* the table of contents

TODO:   search.vim
        Do HighlightConflict at very beginning.
        Handle it separately from NextHightlight.
        Get rid of 'use_props', it's always true.
        Check'debug', may no longer be meaningful as used.

TODO:   show conflicts on startup?

DONE:   boolsetting bug, BUT: see comment with defaults in splice.vim

TODO:   The help has 'splice_initial_diff_*' never referenced.
        What are they?

=== Do the other premerge options work? keep-merge3, keep-mergediff

=== If vim version or python problem,
    execute (or option) :cq when popup dismissed

=== boolsetting bug, see comment with defaults in splice.vim

Logging
    vim function Log(string)

    " splice_log_file defaults to $HOME/SPLICE_LOG
    let g:splice_log_file = $HOME .. '/play/SPLICE_LOG'
    " splice_log_enabled defaults to false
    let g:splice_log_enable = v:true

KeyBinding
    Stay compatible with v1.1.0, circa 2012. DirDiff latest is like this.
    NOTE: the Splice bindings are only done after SpliceInit is invoked
          so if Splice is only used from SCM, these bindings should
          not interfere with other plugins. In particular, some of these
          bindings overwrite DirDiff bindings.

    Highest priority are per command mappings
        g:splice_bind_<command> = '<mapping>'
        where <command> ::= Grid | Loupe | ...
    For example
        g:splice_bind_Grid = '-g'  " this is the current default
        g:splice_bind_Grid = '<M-g>'  " use the meta key

    There is a flag to control whether or not to setup mappings for the
    Splice commands.
        g:splice_bind_enable
    This flag Defaults to 1 for compatibility. But it is recommended to
    explicitly set this if you want mappings. The default may change in
    the future to avoid changing user mappings by default.

    Per command mappings take precedence. Any commands not mapped with
    "g:splice_bind_*" will get the default mapping. If a command mapping
    is an empty string, '', or set to 'None', it will not be mapped.

    Copy/paste to assist setup; these are the defaults (<prefix> == '-')
        g:splice_bind_Grid             = '-g'
        g:splice_bind_Loupe            = '-l'
