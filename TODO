===========  Issues from the original Splice  ===========

https://github.com/sjl/splice.vim

Ability to quickly switch both panels in 'compare' mode
        https://github.com/sjl/splice.vim/issues/32
    Commented: Maybe user defined shortcuts? Like `bind_user`.

can't open submodule dir
        https://github.com/sjl/splice.vim/issues/25
    fugitive interactions?

Problem when file path contains dot
        https://github.com/sjl/splice.vim/issues/26
    python traceback

Splice inserts carriage returns (^M) to every line in the final
version when merging text file
        https://github.com/sjl/splice.vim/issues/24
    Commented: How to reproduce?

Splice fails to load if any input file is missing
        https://github.com/sjl/splice.vim/issues/23
    Commented: What should happen? Difftool mode?

Splice closes immediatly on Windows
        https://github.com/sjl/splice.vim/issues/20
    Commented: still an issue?

Bug in changing files to compare
        https://github.com/sjl/splice.vim/issues/10
    Commented:
    Hi @dwijnand , @Profpatsch, @vlmarek
    Think that this issue and #16 and #32 all the same thing?

The rest of them are very old, assume they're dealt with.


=== Do the other premerge options work? keep-merge3, keep-mergediff

===========  UI  ===========

TODO:   option to disable mouse/rollover

TODO:   Baloon popup when hover over a command?

TODO:   Shortcut as button with list and popup when hover?
        Which commands valid: grey out , don't higlight rollover

        Which file can be selected: orig, one, two, res
            May, or may not, depend on focused window.
            In some cases, rather than loading that file into window,
            it switches to the window named.

TODO:   If not vim9script, map SpliceInit (or whatever) to no vim9 message.
        Or, make message clear that the plugin should be removed?

=========== DOC  ===========

TODO:   doc logging
        the log file is never trunctated, persists, grows without limit

=========== DONE ===========

DONE:   boolsetting bug, BUT: see comment with defaults in splice.vim

Logging
    vim function Log(string)

    " splice_log_file defaults to $HOME/SPLICE_LOG
    let g:splice_log_file = $HOME .. '/play/SPLICE_LOG'
    " splice_log_enabled defaults to false
    let g:splice_log_enable = v:true

KeyBinding
    Stay compatible with v1.1.0, circa 2012. DirDiff latest is like this.
    NOTE: the Splice bindings are only done after SpliceInit is invoked
          so if Splice is only used from SCM, these bindings should
          not interfere with other plugins. In particular, some of these
          bindings overwrite DirDiff bindings.

    Highest priority are per command mappings
        g:splice_bind_<command> = '<mapping>'
        where <command> ::= Grid | Loupe | ...
    For example
        g:splice_bind_Grid = '-g'  " this is the current default
        g:splice_bind_Grid = '<M-g>'  " use the meta key

    There is a flag to control whether or not to setup mappings for the
    Splice commands.
        g:splice_bind_enable
    This flag Defaults to 1 for compatibility. But it is recommended to
    explicitly set this if you want mappings. The default may change in
    the future to avoid changing user mappings by default.

    Per command mappings take precedence. Any commands not mapped with
    "g:splice_config.bind_*" will get the default mapping. If a command
    mapping is an empty string, '', or set to 'None', it will not be mapped.

    Copy/paste to assist setup; these are the defaults (<prefix> == '-')
        g:splice_config.bind_Grid             = '-g'
        g:splice_config.bind_Loupe            = '-l'
        g:splice_config.bind_Compare          = '-c'
