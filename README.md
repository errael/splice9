## Splice9

Splice9 is a post Vim9.1 plugin for resolving conflicts during three-way merges.

`Splice9` is a pure vim9script port of Splice. The original Splice is a vimscript/python hybrid.
The original Splice installation documentation and instructions for hooking
up to your Version Control System are still applicable.

Some of the Splice9 UI enhancements:
- Additional status info (compact) in the HUD (Heads Up Display).<br>
  See [HUD](https://github.com/errael/splice9/wiki/HUD) for a description of the new features.
- The action buttons in the HUD are clickable.
- Rollover highlight for active HUD buttons.
- Click for popup of shortcuts.
- Can specify each action's ":map"/shortcut individually.
- Can set "use meta" and the meta key is used instead of using g:mapleader.
- Version control system configuration the same as original Splice. 

Visit [the original site](https://docs.stevelosh.com/splice.vim/) for
installation and other information. There's a video demo.

In vim do `:he Splice`.
